# Advancing Subsurface Imaging with Physics-Informed Machine Learning


## 🌍 Overview

This project revolutionizes **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)** by combining physics-based models with machine learning to create accurate subsurface velocity maps. Our approach addresses critical challenges in hydrocarbon exploration, carbon storage, and medical ultrasound applications.

### Key Achievements
- **28.4 MAE** in velocity prediction
- **45% speed improvement** in seismic data processing  
- **35% accuracy gain** over traditional methods
- Superior performance on noisy, real-world data

## 🚀 Why This Matters

**Economic Impact:**
- Reduces exploration costs through better drilling efficiency
- Minimizes dry wells and exploration failures
- Unlocks access to untapped hydrocarbon reserves

**Technical Innovation:**
- Bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world seismic data
- Outperforms CNN-based approaches on high-noise datasets
- Enables Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) through accurate velocity predictions

## 📊 Dataset

**Input:** Seismic waveforms
- Format: `.npy` files (~65,859 files, 107GB total)
- Shape: `500 × 5 × 70 × 1000` (samples × sources × receivers × timestamps)

**Output:** Velocity maps  
- Shape: `500 × 70 × 70` (samples × height × width)

**Evaluation:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on velocity predictions
